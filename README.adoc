== WildFly Swarm

WildFly Swarm offers an innovative approach to packaging and running Java EE applications by packaging them with just enough of the server runtime to "java -jar" your application.

==== Flexible
Simply specify WildFly Swarm maven dependencies to bundle just the parts of the Java EE 7 WildFly application server that you need. Don't use EJBs or JPA? Great, nothing is bundled unless you specify it! 

==== Straightforward
Generate uberjar, or generate a .war and deploy to any Java EE compatible application server.
